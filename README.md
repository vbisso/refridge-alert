# Overview

This project showcases a food management app built using React Native. The goal of the app is to enhance our skills in building user-friendly mobile applications while focusing on state management, modular components, and local data persistence.
This project was developed to learn more about React Native, state management with hooks, modular architecture in mobile apps, and how to handle data storage effectively.
The app allows users to:
* Add food items by providing their name, category, and expiration date.
* View a list of saved foods with their details.
* Delete any unwanted food items from the list.
* Filter list of saved foods by category, name or exp. date.
* The data is saved locally using AsyncStorage, ensuring users' entries persist even after closing the app.

# Development Environment

The app was built using the following tools and technologies:
* React Native: For building the app UI and functionality.
* Expo: A powerful platform for building React Native applications. Expo provides a robust development environment that simplifies the process of creating, testing, and deploying mobile apps.
* Node.js: As the runtime environment to manage the React Native project dependencies and development server.
* React Native: For creating and running the project.
* AsyncStorage: To enable local data persistence.
* VS Code: As the primary code editor for development.

Programming language and libraries:
* Language: JavaScript 
Libraries:
* @react-native-async-storage/async-storage for local storage.
* @react-native-community/datetimepicker for selecting food expiration dates.
* react-native-gesture-handler for enabling scroll functionality within lists.

# Future Work


* Enhanced Styling: Improve the UI/UX to make the app more visually appealing and user-friendly.
* Notification System: Implement a notification system to remind users of foods that are about to expire.
* Settings Screen: Implement a second screen that allows users personalize their notifications settings (allows users to choose when they want to receive notifications).
